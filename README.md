## ‚ùÑÔ∏è What is a Snowflake ID?

A Snowflake ID is a unique, 64-bit identifier that is highly available and sorted by time. It was developed by Twitter to generate unique IDs for tweets and other objects in their distributed systems. Unlike traditional database sequences, Snowflake IDs are generated without the need for a centralized authority, making them ideal for distributed environments.

A Snowflake ID is composed of the following parts:

- **Timestamp (41 bits):** The number of milliseconds since a custom epoch.
- **Node ID (10 bits):** A unique identifier for the machine or process generating the ID.
- **Sequence (12 bits):** A sequence number that is incremented for each ID generated within the same millisecond.

This structure allows for the generation of up to 4,096 unique IDs per millisecond per node.

## ‚ú® Features

- ‚úÖ **BigInt Support**: Natively handles 64-bit integers for precision and safety.
- ‚úÖ **Customizable**: Configure node IDs and epochs to suit your distributed system's needs.
- ‚úÖ **Deconstruction**: Easily extract timestamp, node ID, and sequence from any Snowflake ID.
- ‚úÖ **High-Performance**: Generates millions of IDs per second.
- ‚úÖ **Pure TypeScript**: Written entirely in TypeScript with zero dependencies.

## üì¶ Installation

```bash
pnpm install @se-oss/snowflake-sequence
```

## üìñ Usage

```typescript
import { Snowflake } from '@se-oss/snowflake-sequence';

// Create a new Snowflake generator with a unique node ID.
const snowflake = new Snowflake({
  nodeId: 1,
  epoch: 1640995200000, // Optional: Jan 1, 2022
});

// Generate a new ID.
const id = snowflake.nextId();
console.log(id);
// => 173242904923537409n

// Deconstruct an ID to get its component parts.
const deconstructed = Snowflake.deconstruct(id);
console.log(deconstructed);
// {
//   timestamp: 1640995200000n,
//   nodeId: 1n,
//   sequence: 1n,
//   epoch: 1288834974657n // The default Twitter epoch
// }
```

## üìö API

### `new Snowflake(options)`

Creates a new Snowflake generator instance.

- `options.nodeId` (`number`): A unique identifier for the node (0-1023). **Required**.
- `options.epoch` (`number`): A custom epoch timestamp in milliseconds. **Optional**. Defaults to the Twitter epoch (`1288834974657`).

### `snowflake.nextId()`

Generates a new Snowflake ID as a `bigint`.

### `Snowflake.deconstruct(id)`

A static method to deconstruct a Snowflake ID into its component parts.

- `id` (`bigint`): The Snowflake ID to deconstruct.

Returns an object with the following properties:

- `timestamp` (`bigint`)
- `nodeId` (`bigint`)
- `sequence` (`bigint`)
- `epoch` (`bigint`)
